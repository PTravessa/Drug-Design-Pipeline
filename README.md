# Title: Drug Design and Pipeline Development for Proteinopathies
Problem:\
The lack of knowledge at the molecular level of the mechanisms of action of potential drugs in
inhibiting the aggregation of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is one of the major obstacles to in silico and in vitro drug design
protocols. \
\
Objectives:
1. To develop/investigate a set of structural and/or dynamic descriptors to evaluate potential
model protein aggregation inhibitor drugs based on the structural and/or dynamic changes
induced in the protein through the formation of protein-drug complexes.
2. Develop a pipeline using molecular simulation methods and/or machine learning algorithms
to develop protein aggregation inhibitor drugs linked to neurodegenerative diseases.

Methods:\
\
− Molecular simulations:\
  • Molecular dynamics simulations using the GROMACS program in order to study the
structures and dynamics of model proteins using coarse-grained and all-atom force
fields.\
\
− Structural Descriptors:\
  • Implement/investigate analysis methods in order to select a set of structural and/or
dynamic descriptors (e.g., PCA- Principal Component Analysis).\
  • Develop analysis tools in Python in order to incorporate various analyses into a
pipeline.\
\
− Evaluation of drug candidates:\
  • Analyze the effect of potential drugs on the aggregation of model proteins through
molecular dynamics simulations.
